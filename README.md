# Machine Learning - Tensorflow.js

## Steps 
- Prepare Data: You prepare the data, separating features (inputs) and labels (outputs).
- Create Model: You define the structure of the model, in this case, a simple linear regression with a single dense layer.
- Compile Model: You specify the optimizer and loss function to configure how the model will learn.
- Train Model: You train the model using your data for a specified number of epochs, during which it adjusts its parameters to minimize the loss.
- Make Predictions: After training, you can use the model to make predictions based on new input.

## Key ML Concepts

- Features (x_train): Input data used for learning.
- Labels (y_train): The output or target values we want the model to predict.
- Model Architecture: Defines how the model learns from data (Sequential model with one Dense layer).
- Optimizer (SGD): Adjusts the modelâ€™s parameters to minimize the loss.
- Loss Function (Mean Squared Error): Measures how well the model's predictions match the actual labels.
- Epochs: Number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset
