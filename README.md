# Machine Learning

- Features (x_train): Input data used for learning.
- Labels (y_train): The output or target values we want the model to predict.
- Model Architecture: Defines how the model learns from data (Sequential model with one Dense layer).
- Optimizer (SGD): Adjusts the modelâ€™s parameters to minimize the loss.
-  Loss Function (Mean Squared Error): Measures how well the model's predictions match the actual labels.
- Epochs: Number of times the model will iterate over the entire training dataset
