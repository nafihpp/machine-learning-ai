Before diving into libraries, you need to understand the core concepts of ML. These concepts are language-agnostic, so once you get a good understanding of them, you'll be able to apply them regardless of the language you're using.

Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning: Learn the difference between tasks where you have labeled data (e.g., classification, regression) vs. tasks with unlabeled data (e.g., clustering).

Training a Model: ML models learn patterns from data, typically by training them on a dataset and testing their accuracy on unseen data.

Evaluation Metrics: You need to know metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification, and mean squared error for regression.

Overfitting/Underfitting: Know the difference between a model that's too complex (overfitting) and one that's too simple (underfitting).
