Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In ML, computers learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions based on that data, without being explicitly programmed to do so.

 - Supervised Learning: The model learns from labeled data (i.e., data where the input is paired with the correct output). The goal is to predict the output for unseen data.
    Examples: Email spam detection, image classification.
 - Unsupervised Learning: The model finds patterns in data without labels. It’s used to group similar items or reduce data dimensions.
    Examples: Clustering (like grouping customers by behavior), anomaly detection.
 - Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback (rewards or penalties). It’s like trial and error.
    Examples: Game AI, robotic control systems.
